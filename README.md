# Discovery Testing the Game of Life

Justin Searls has an awesome [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIuJbrOVyGjl0keQ-QyiMEOCvmabJEf0t) where he introduces the concept of Discovery Testing. Justin uses Java and the Mockito framework throughout the series. This repository is me trying to replicate the examples using Ruby and RSpec.
